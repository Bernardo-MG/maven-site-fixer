/**
 * Utilities class for upgrading XHTML code to HTML5.
 * <p>
 * This was created for Maven Sites. These are built through Doxia which
 * supports XHTML, and not HTML5, and so this library generates outdated pages.
 * <p>
 * The various methods contained in this class aim to fix this problem, and will
 * transform several known mistakes into valid HTML5, but they won't transform
 * the full page. The end user should make sure that the template being used,
 * probably a Maven Skin, matches expectations.
 * <p>
 * The <a href="https://github.com/Bernardo-MG/docs-maven-skin">Docs Maven
 * Skin</a> and its requirements have dictated the development of this class.
 * For more generic methods use the {@link com.wandrell.velocity.tool.HtmlUtils
