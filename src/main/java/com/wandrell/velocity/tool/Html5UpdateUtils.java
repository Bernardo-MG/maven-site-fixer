/**
 * Utilities class for upgrading a Velocity's XHTML code to HTML5.
 * <p>
 * This was created for Maven Sites. These are built through Doxia which
 * supports XHTML, and not HTML5, and so this library generates outdated pages.
 * <p>
 * The various methods contained in this class aim to fix this problem, and will
 * transform several known mistakes into valid HTML5, but they won't transform
 * the full page. The end user should make sure that the template being used,
 * probably a Maven Skin, matches expectations.
 * <p>
 * There is a problem with this class. It was developed for the Docs Maven Skin,
 * and is tailored for the needs of that project, which makes use of Bootstrap
 * for the UI.
 * <p>
 * The class makes use of <a href="http://jsoup.org/">jsoup</a> for querying and
 * editing. This library will process the HTML code received by the methods, so
 * only the contents of the {@code <body>} tag (or the full HTML if this tag is
 * missing) will be used.
