/**
 * Utilities class for manipulating HTML, to be used as an extension of the
 * Velocity templating engine.
 * <p>
 * The methods offered help enhancing the look of a Maven Site by manipulating
 * the HTML structure.
 * <p>
 * The class makes use of <a href="http://jsoup.org/">jsoup</a> for querying and
 * editing. This library will process the HTML code received by the methods, so
 * only the contents of the {@code <body>} tag (or the full HTML if this tag is
 * missing) will be used.
 * <p>
 * Take into account that while the returned HTML will be correct, the validity
 * of the received HTML won't be checked. That falls fully on the hands of the
 * user.
 * <p>
 * This class has been created from the HTML Tool class from the
 * <a href="http://andriusvelykis.github.io/reflow-maven-skin/">Reflow Maven
 * Skin</a>.
